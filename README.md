# Polluted Plains
## What this is
Polluted Plains is a game that I have made for a Year 10 assessment, with the topic of 'Games for Change'. The project requires me to create a 2D platformer game in Unity, create assets in Piskel and use Github to create a repository for my game.

The premise of the game is to clean up the overly polluted world, through growing new plants and cleaning up the environment. 

# User Documentation
## Controls
To control the character, the player uses the keys A and D on the keyboard to move left and right, the space bar to jump and E to interact with certain objects or NPCs.

## What I intended to make
I intend to make a 2D, pixel art/8-bit platformer game named ‘Polluted Plains’ that will be about a polluted world which the player has to make clean again, which will be done by having the player pick up litter, plant trees or flowers, and sabotage a coal power plant while building your own, sustainable one. The story in my game will progress by you first waking up in a polluted world, with nobody else because they all left due to the bad conditions. The player will explore the area for a short while, until they come across a bee that needs pollen, but has no flowers nearby. After some dialogue, the bee will then follow the player and give them tips to help them navigate the environment. After the player finds a flower and uses the seeds to plant more, they come across a tree seed, and plant that too. These trees have special properties, as they clear the polluted environment close to them, and they will act as a checkpoint and healing area, at the cost of the tree rotting.  

My game will be intended for a younger audience, and this is because they may not be educated as well as others in the field of sustainability and pollution. My game will change them in a way that reflects my chosen social issue by teaching them about what pollution can do, how it may be caused and potential ways to stop air, water, or land pollution.
